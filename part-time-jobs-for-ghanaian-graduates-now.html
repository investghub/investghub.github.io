				<p>You are currently at a cross-road in need of a way to boost your income (if already employed) or sustain you (unemployed).  
					The reality is that as prices of goods and services go higher, the standard of living suffers if income levels do not 
					match with them. Thus, the need for a part-time job to cushion that effect.<br>
					<br>
					In today's Ghana, part-time jobs are very sought for and I know you are reading this post because you searched for it. 
					Therefore, find below 3 part-time jobs in Ghana to satisfy your curiosity.</p><br>
					
					<h2 style="font-size: 35px; font-weight: bolder;">Part-Time Jobs, What are They ?</h2>
					<p>Part-time jobs are a type of employment based on work schedules that are considered flexible or temporary. A typical 
						part-time work involves working for short periods of time in flexible modes of operation.
		
						<b>It is very important to know and understand that part-time workers are sometimes considered independent workers.</b> 
						That means you are sometimes responsible for expenses related to your work such as taxes, health insurance and other 
						benefits that come with traditional jobs. <br>
						<br>
						My advice to you is that to really make it with part-time jobs, <b>one best way is to stack jobs, which is the 
							tried-and-tested idea of working multiple jobs at once.</b> When you do this, you are opening up more income 
							streams never will never get in a tight spot if one job ends (short periods) or becomes less feasible (pay not 
							worth it anymore). Take this instance, you can work with the Electoral Commission during stipulated periods and 
							then be writing articles for newspapers at your free time.<br>
						<br>
						Due to the flexibility part-time jobs offer, you can do two or even three jobs at the same time to increase your 
						income. This compared to traditional jobs where you have to keep set hours is a no-brainer.</p>

				<img height="300" src="./assets/img/demo/Ghana-Statistical-Service-logo.png" alt="GSS logo">
				<p>The Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) set up by the Statistical Service Act, 2019 (Act 1003), is established as <b>the central 
					statistics producing and co-ordinating institution for the National Statistical System and to strengthen the production of

					<i><b>Source: Ghana Statistical Service website.</b></i>

				<h2>Private School Tutor</h2>
				<img height="200" src="./assets/img/demo/GNAPS-logo.jpeg" alt="GNAPS logo">
				<p>Getting engaged in a private school is one of the best paid part time jobs in the country at the moment. Private schools 
				include basic, second cycle, and tertiary institutions that are owned by individuals. <br>
				<br>
				There are lots of private schools springing up of late for these two reasons amongst others. Firstly, the increase in 
				population has created the need for more schools to be opened to absorb all those who cannot get admission into the public 
				schools. Secondly, the seemingly <b>lack of quality education has resulted in most parents rather preferring private schools 
					despite the huge amount of fees charged by these institutions.</b><br>
				<br>
				The increase in numbers and subsequent increase in student population in these schools means that the services of tutors are 
				readily needed. <b>It is worthy to note that, due to operational costs and legal requirements, almost all these schools prefer 
					engaging tutors on part time basis.</b><br>
				</p>
				
				<p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</p>
				<p>Note that many basic private schools require at least an HND or First Degree qualification to be eligible to teach.</p>

				<p style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: bolder;">How Much Can You Make in a Part-Time Job?</p>
				<p>These part-time jobs make payments (fixed or flexible) depending on duration(EC and GSS), commitment and quality of work 
					(Private schools).</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
					<li><b>Electoral Commission of Ghana allowance rates ranges from GHS130 to GHS2000*.</b></li>
					<li><b>Ghana Statistical Service allowance rates ranges from GHS2000 to GHS2950*.</b></li>
					<li><b>Private Tutor salary ranges from GHS400 to GHS1500*.</b></li>

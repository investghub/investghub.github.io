				  	</figure>	
					<br>
					The smiles on the faces of the athletes tells a different story.<br>
					<br>
					"A smile can hide so much", so the adage goes.<br>
					<br>
					<b>The bitter truth is that sports in Ghana needs a major revival. A kind that will arrest its backwardness and reposition it as 
					a force to reckon with.</b><br>
					<br>
					Take a look at this:<br>
					<br>
					<figure>
						<img src="./assets/img/demo/Ghana-medal-table-olympics24.png" alt="Ghana Medal Table Olympic 24" class="shadow" style="width:100%">
						<figcaption>Search Results for Ghana on Medal Table, Paris Olympics 2024.</figcaption>
				  	</figure>
					<br>
					I couln't believe what I was seeing so I quickly refreshed the page and it returned same. Of course we were not the only country 
					that did not win a medal at the Olympics but hey, there is a saying in my local dialect that "Su waa wo su" which literally 
					means "cry your own cry"<br>
					<br>
					I cannot compare Ghana's sports to another country. Oh wait, I can.<br>
					<br>
					How, you may ask? I can compare Ghana sports to countries in same sub-region with similar or even less renowned prowess in 
					sports.<br>
					<br>
					The table below is why I can.<br>
					<br>
					<figure>
						<img src="./assets/img/demo/Africa-medal-table-olympics24.png" alt="Africa Medal Table Olympic 24" class="shadow" style="width:100%">
						<figcaption>Africa's Medal Table, Paris Olympics 2024.</figcaption>

					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">Vintage Ghana Sports</h3>

						<img src="./assets/img/demo/azumah.png" alt="Azumah Nelson" class="shadow" style="width: 200; height: 300px;">
						<figcaption>Azumah Nelson, WBC and IBF World Champion</figcaption>
				  	</figure>
					<br>
					Gone now are the days when Ghana produced world and African champions in disciplines such as boxing and football. The likes of 
					Azumah Nelson (pictured above), Abedi Pele, Ike Quartey, The entire 1982 AFCON squad, Edward Blay, The entire 1992 Black Meteors 
					football squad, Prince Amartey, Isaac Dogboe and more recently the 2009 Black Satellites squad, Samuel Takyi, Black Stars (2006, 2010)  
					ensured that Ghana was firmly planted on world sports map.<br> 
					<br>
					<figure>
						<img src="./assets/img/demo/Ghana u20 world cup winners.png" alt="Ghana U20 world cup winners 2009" class="shadow" style="width: 100%">
						<figcaption>Ghana U20 world cup winners 2009</figcaption>
				  	</figure>
					<br>
					Fast forward 2024 where Ghana did not even offer any competiton in the just ended Paris Olympics and came home empty handed.<br>
					<br>
					Another sad reality is how the Black Stars (Men footballing team), Ghana's flagship sports icon due to their prowess in past 
					World and African football competitons, is now an also ran getting 
					<a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn5zd3zv3w6o">whipped by teams</a> hitherto were miles below in footballing 
					terms.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">Why is Ghana's sports down?</h3>
					The answer is simple. Lack of investment.<br>
					<br>
					But then, what is the size of Ghana's Sports Budget?<br>
					<br>
					<figure>
						<img src="./assets/img/demo/Ghana Sports budget for past 7 years.png" alt="Ghana Sports Budget for Past 7 years" class="shadow" style="width: 100%">
						<figcaption>Ghana Sports Budget (2018-2024)</figcaption>
				  	</figure>
					<br>
					Looking at the amount of monies allocated during the years it clearly shows a vast increase in budget allocation, so the 
					hundred million cedis question is, "why the decline in Ghana sports?". The answer to that will be a topic for another day.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">Football and Mismanagement</h3>
					This is well documented. Football, which is the passion of the nation, has endured so many disgusting and embarrassing 
					headlines for corruption of highest levels.<br>
					<br>
					Football in Ghana is painful to follow because a few people, out of their greed and selfishness, schemed to enrich themselves 
					at the expense of all Ghanaians.<br>
					<br>
					Take a look at this:<br>
					<br>
					<figure>
						<img src="./assets/img/demo/Fifa money.png" alt="Table of money received from FIFA in world cups" class="shadow" style="width: 400; height: 280px;">
						<figcaption>FIFA allocation to GFA for three world cups</figcaption>
				  	</figure>
					<br>
					How were these huge monies spent? "Who the cap fits, let them wear it".<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">What was then but not now</h3>
					Another reason for Ghana's performance decline in sports is why, despite a considerable increase in budgetary allocations, 
					the following two vital activities/events have not seen any major investment for decades. it's unthinkable, to be honest.<br>
					<br>
					<h5 style= "font-weight: bold;">1. Basic and Second Cycle Inter-schools Sports Competitions</h5>
					<figure>
						<img src="./assets/img/demo/inter-schools-athletics.jpg" alt="Inter schools athletics" class="shadow" style="width: 400; height: 280px;">
						<figcaption>Ghana Inter Schools Athletics</figcaption>
				  	</figure>
					I repeat. It's just unthinkable that one of the best medium to unearth sporting talents in Ghana has been handled like a routine academic 
					exercise. Infact, as I write this post, sporting competitions for second cycle TVET institutions have been postponed for two 
					years running. Reason is lack of funds.<br>
					<br>
					How come and why would our leaders be so forgetful and unconcerned with the fact that many of our sporting heroes were spotted and scouted for 
					greatness during these annual competitions.<br>
					<br>
					Why are these competitions important, you may ask?<br>
					<br>
					<figure>
						<img src="./assets/img/demo/Ghana high jump.jpeg" alt="high Jump in Ghana" class="shadow" style="width: 400; height: 280px;">
						<figcaption>High Jump in Ghana schools</figcaption>
				  	</figure>
					The basic and second cycle inter-schools sports festival, affectionately called 'inter-co' back then, gave young Ghanaians the opportunity 
					rise to the very top in honours and fame through sports. These sports festivals ensured that students honed their 
					skills in various sporting disciplines rather than only football, thereby generating more interest from younger boys and girls 
					and the general public.<br>
					<br>
					<h5 style= "font-weight: bold;">2. Annual Milo Marathon</h5>
					<figure>
						<img src="./assets/img/demo/milomarathon.jpg" alt="Athlete running marathon" class="shadow" style="width: 400; height: 280px;">
						<figcaption>Marathon organised by Milo (Nestle Ghana)</figcaption>
				  	</figure>
					For over 29 years, the Milo marathon has been a great source for both sports and entertainment.<br>
					<br>
					I keenly remember as a child, growing up in the suburbs of Dansoman (Accra), this was one event that was so much anticipated by myself 
					and colleagues.<br>
					<br>
					The music, side-games, performers, influx of many visitors from different parts of Ghana and beyond, made this occassion a not miss for 
					many Ghanaians.<br>
					<br>
					For your information, yours truly was so much inspired by what I saw that I participated in the childrens' edition of the marathon once 
					and placed a not-so-cool position of 185. This feat was achieved after just two days of training and conviction. Needless to say I really 
					suffered in this marathon but managed to complete. I was only awarded a certificate for my effort.<br>
					<br>
					Unfortunately, this marathon has not been organized since 2016.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">THE NEED FOR PROPER INVESTMENT</h3>
					When you look at the current situation in sports, the real issue is not lack of funding as evident in the numerous sports sponsorships 
					around. <br>
					<br>
					All evidence points to the fact that companies in Ghana choose to sponsor sporting activities to improve their image and/or boost sales.<br>
					<br>
					Well, that's a step in the right direction.<br>
					<br>
					What Ghana needs in terms of sporting investments is sustainable facilities that will ensure that talents are groomed professionally 
					to attain their maximum potentials.<br>
					<br>
					<figure>
						<img src="./assets/img/demo/centre of excellence.jpeg" alt="Ghanaman Centre of Excellence" class="shadow" style="width: 400; height: 280px;">
						<figcaption>Ghanaman Centre of Excellence</figcaption>
				  	</figure>
					  <h5 style= "font-weight: bold;">Centre of Excellences</h5>
					  The Ghanaman Centre of Excellence built by the Ghana Football Association (GFA), a noteworthy move, should be replicated in many 
					  parts of the country since talents are not only found in the southern part.<br>
					  <br>
					  The Ghana Athletics Association (GAA), Ghana Olympic Committee (GOC), Ghana Boxing Association (GBA), Ghana Hockey Association (GHA) 
					  and all other Sports Associations in the country, should as a matter of urgency, setup sustainable facilities in many parts of Ghana to 
					  unearth raw and hidden talents.<br>
					  <br>
					  <h5 style= "font-weight: bold;">Training and Coaching Upgrade</h5>
					  Ghana is not short of coaches and trainers.<br>
					  <br>
					  What we are short of are ones with the necessary knowhow on modern sports. Modern sports is so advanced in every aspect that many of 
					  how we carry out our sports are as outdated as the Golden Goal rule in soccer.<br>
					  <br>
					  There should be a conscious effort by government to invest in the upgrading of skills and knowledge of coaches/trainers.<br>
					  <br>
					  <h5 style= "font-weight: bold;">Effective Scouting System</h5>
					  What Ghana lacks is a system that identifies talents in its raw form for future polishing. In short, an effective scouting 
					  system<br>
					  <br>
					  You and I will testify to that boy or girl, back in the days, who looked so talented in a particular sports discipline winning much 
					  accolades and honours, but ended up in oblivion with a different career path.<br>
					  <br>
					  An effective scouting system would have turned these people into professionals who could also may have become the next Azumah Nelson, 
					  Abedi Pele, Michael Essien, Stephen Appiah, Asamoah Gyan and Mohammed Kudus.<br>
					  <br>
					  <figure>
						<img src="./assets/img/demo/youngessien.jpeg" alt="Michael Essien in youthful days" class="shadow" style="width: 400; height: 280px;">
						<figcaption>Michael Essien in youthful days</figcaption>

						<figcaption>Raw Talents in Football</figcaption>
				  	</figure>

						<figcaption>Raw Rowing Talents</figcaption>

						<figcaption>The next Noah Lyles</figcaption>

						<figcaption>Raw Table Tennis talents</figcaption>
				  	</figure>
					The above is not exhaustive. I have seen strong men and women with weights (Weightlifting), children fight each other with much ferrocity 
					(Boxing), children with slings (Archery) and children swimming in water bodies (Swimming).<br>
					<br>
					These are raw talents when nurtured could mature into world beaters.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">I HAVE A DREAM</h3>
					Ghana winning the African Cup of Nations once more.<br>
					<br>
					Ghana dominating World Youth Soccer.<br>
					<br>
					Ghana reaching semi-finals of world cup and even winning it.<br>
					<br>
					Ghanaian winning gold at Olympics and World Championships.<br>
					<br>
					Unemployment rates reducing drastically due to sports.<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					I rest my case, Ghana.<br>

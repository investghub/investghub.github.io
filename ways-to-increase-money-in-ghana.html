				<p>So now you have been thinking for awhile on how to make more money to live a comfortable life.<br>
					<br>
					"There are many ways to kill a cat", so the adage goes.<br>
					<br>
					<b>This literally means that there are so many ways to make more money.</b><br>
					<br>
					The question is, does that way smell of illegality? Does society frown upon that way? Does taking that get in the way of 
					someone else?<br>
					<br>
					What I have compiled below is a list of twenty (20) legal, positive and scriptural ways of increasing your money.<br>
					<br>
					Increasing your money here means making your money work for you and gaining profits in return.<br>
					<br>
					Now let's go:
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">1. Giving</h3>
					<img src="./assets/img/demo/giving.png" alt="Hand giving" class="shadow" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;">
					<br>
					The first and best way to increase your money is through giving.<br>
					<br>
					Don't be surprised. <br>
					<br>
					Luke 6:38 says <i>"Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, 
					shall men give into your bosom..."</i><br>
					<br>
					This is a spiritual law that cannot be argued.<br>
					<br>
					What you should know and understand is that almost all wealthy people you know of were and are still givers.<br>
					<br>
					So go ahead. Give out your money for free and see your money increase.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">2. Tithing</h3>
					<img src="./assets/img/demo/ten.PNG" alt="10%" class="shadow" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;">
					<br>
					Tithing is a biblical principle of sacrificial giving.<br>
					<br>
					Tithing can be explained as the act of giving a percentage (1/10) of your income back to God's work. Tithing comes with a 
					promise and this is well portrayed in Malachi 3:10 as follows:<br>
					<br>
					<i>"Bring all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be food in My house, And try Me now in this," Says the LORD of 
					hosts, "If I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you such blessing that there will not be room 
					enough to receive it."</i><br>
					<br>
					There you have it. Be a regular tither and see your money increase.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">3. Savings</h3>
					<img src="./assets/img/demo/saving.png" alt="Money in sack" class="shadow" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;">
					<br>
					There are abundant savings account schemes in Ghana. <br>
					<br>
					Every bank offers it. <br>
					<br>
					There are micro savings organizations also who offer same. <br>
					<br>
					Savings involve keeping your money in a bank or its alternative for a period of time as agreed on by both parties with 
					interest.<br>
					<br>
					The downside to savings is with its returns as one should not expect to earn so much from this scheme.<br>
					<br>
					Notwithstanding, savings are very safe and not subject to market volatility.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">4. Fixed Deposit</h3>
					<img src="./assets/img/demo/fixed.png" alt="Fixed deposit" class="shadow" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;">
					<br>
					One way to increase your money is by engaging in Fixed Deposit investment.<br>
					<br>
					Fixed deposit can be explained as an investment opportunity where money is deposited for a fixed period with fixed interest rate.<br>
					<br>
					Fixed deposits offer higher interest rates as compared to ordinary savings investment.<br>
					<br>
					The good news is that almost all well meaning banks in Ghana offer this investment opportunity.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">5. Treasury Bills</h3>
					How do you give a loan to a whole Central government?<br>
					<br>
					Through <a href="understanding-treasury-bills-in-ghana.html">Treasury Bills.</a><br>
					<br>
					A Treasury Bill is a short term debt security made available by the Bank of Ghana (BOG) which involves investing your money 
					in a fixed portfolio for a stipulated period and earning interest on your capital.<br>
					<br>
					To increase your money, you can take the <a href="treasury-bills-91-day.html">91-day</a>, 
					<a href="treasury-bills-182-day.html">182-day</a> or 365-day options.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">6. Bonds</h3>
					Bonds which are sometimes referred to as debt securities, are an obligation by one party to make payment(s) to another 
					party in the future.<br>
					<br>
					These payments come in the form of interests which may be fixed or variable.<br>
					<br>
					Bonds are bought and sold on GFIM only through Banks and Licensed Dealing Members also known as Brokers.<br>
					<br>
					The two main bond issuers are the government of Ghana and public companies.<br>
					<br>
					There you have it. Invest in bonds and increase your money.<br>
					<br>
					Check this post on <a href="understanding-investment-bonds-in-ghana.html">bond investments</a> to know more.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">7. Shares</h3>
					<img src="./assets/img/demo/shares.jpg" alt="Group of people discussing growth" class="shadow" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;">
					<br>
					Shares can be explained as money given by an investor to a company when he or she invest in that company.<br>
					<br>
					When you buy shares, you become a part-owner (shareholder) of that company.<br>
					<br>
					You earn dividends (profit) as a shareholder.<br>
					<br>
					This profit is the increase on your money invested.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">8. Trading Cryptocurrency</h3>
					<img src="./assets/img/demo/buyand sell.png" alt="Buy and sell arrows" class="shadow" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;">
					<br>
					A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of money that operate on decentralized networks based on blockchain 
					technology unlike traditional currencies issued by governments (known as fiat currencies).<br>
					<br>
					You can buy and sell cryptocurrencies in Ghana through exchanges (trading platforms) such as 
					<a href="https://www.binance.com/activity/referral-entry/CPA?ref=CPA_002PC5SXWM">Binance</a> and 
					<a href="https://www.okx.com/join/37816050">OKX</a>.<br>
					<br>
					To increase your money, you need to buy low and sell high and this requires experience and patience.<br>
					<br>
					Check this post on <a href="what-are-cryptocurrencies.html">cryptocurrencies</a> to know more.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">9. Staking Cryptocurrency</h3>
					Staking cryptocurrency can be explained as a process where you lock up your crypto assets for a fixed period to 
					support the operations and security of a blockchain network.<br>
					<br>
					In return, you earn rewards, usually in the form of additional cryptocurrency.<br>
					<br>
					This can be sold on the market to increase your money.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">10. Buying and Holding Cryptocurrency</h3>
					Another way to increase your money is to simply buy cryptocurrencies and hold them.<br>
					<br>
					Holding here means not selling them and anticipating an increase in value.<br>
					<br>
					Consequently, an increase in value will mean an increase in your money.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">11. Setting Up A Business</h3>
					You can greatly increase your money by engaging in business activities.<br>
					<br>
					This could be a provision of a service or the production of something physical.<br>
					<br>
					One key requirement with this is to make sure the activity has the ability to earn profits. Ignore this to 
					your own loss.<br>
					<br>
					Business setups that provide solutions to societal problems are the most successful and anyone who engages in 
					such activities are greatly rewarded.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">12. Rearing Animals</h3>
					<img src="./assets/img/demo/animals.jpg" alt="Livestock" class="shadow" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;">
					<br>
					Even though this can be done in a business setting, rearing animals can also be done wihtout any formalized 
					structures.<br>
					<br>
					For instance, you buy a kid goat at GHS50, carefully raise it into an adult goat and sell it for GHS400.<br>
					<br>
					That's an increase in your money.<br>
					<br>
					Animals that are fast selling include cattle, sheep, goats, chicken, guinea fowl and pigs.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">13. Fish Farming</h3>
					<img src="./assets/img/demo/fish.jpg" alt="Fisherman with a catch" class="shadow" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;">
					<br>
					Even though this requires a high initial capital to start, fish farming is a sure way to boost your money.<br>
					<br>
					Reason? The demand for fish far outweighs the supply.<br>
					<br>
					Fish farming in Ghana can be done by constructing a pond or setting a pond on a water body.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">14. Growing Crops</h3>
					<img src="./assets/img/demo/crops.jpg" alt="Vegetables" class="shadow" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;">
					<br>
					Whilst this, in times past, was considered a job for the impoverished, farming is now a great investment 
					opportunity with capability of great returns.<br>
					<br>
					There are two ways to do this:<br>
					<br>
					First is sponsor the weeding, planting and final harvesting of crops.<br>
					<br>
					The second is buying the produce right after harvest, storing them for awhile and selling for a high price 
					when there is market shortage.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">15. Land Acquisition</h3>
					Land appreciates with time and this is why it is a good investment opportunity.<br>
					<br>
					Depending on the location, a land bought a decade ago will now go for triple or quadruple of its initial value.<br>
					<br>
					In Ghana where the population is still growing, land aqcuisition presents an opportunity.<br>
					<br>
					What opportunity if you may ask?<br>
					<br>
					An opportunity to increase your money.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">16. Real Estate</h3>
					<img src="./assets/img/demo/estate.png" alt="Real estate" class="shadow" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;">
					<br>
					Even though this may include land, it is important we separate them due to how our lands system work.<br>
					<br>
					Real estate can be explained as land and any permanent structures on it, such as houses, apartments, offices, 
					hotels, warehouses and factories.<br>
					<br>
					You can buy, sell, rent or develop real estate for various purposes.<br>
					<br>
					Real estate has great potentials to appreciate in value and generate income through rent.<br>
					<br>
					This is a great way to increase your money.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">17. Soft Loans</h3>
					<img src="./assets/img/demo/loan.png" alt="Two men shaking hands" class="shadow" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;">
					<br>
					Soft loans can be explained as the act of giving out needed help (money) to people for a returns as interest.<br>
					<br>
					This activity is not formalised and is unregulated.<br>
					<br>
					This means that you can only give out soft loans to people you trust since no law will back you in the 
					eventuality of a defualt by the loanee.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">18. Cash Prizes</h3>
					<img src="./assets/img/demo/cashprize.png" alt="A winner of cash" class="shadow" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;">
					<br>
					This can be likened to catching a big fish with a small worm.<br>
					<br>
					Many organizations organize promotional activities that entice customers with the potential to make money when 
					they buy a product or experience a service at a cost.<br>
					<br>
					For example, a promotion for customers to buy a particular drink with a serial inscription and stand the chance 
					to win cash prizes far above the cost of that drink.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">19. Training and Education</h3>
					Do you want to increase your money in a specific trade you are in?<br>
					<br>
					Get more training and education.<br>
					<br>
					Training and education improves your knowledge set and this ultimately makes you more effective and efficient.<br>
					<br>
					Effectiveness and efficiency results in reduced cost of production, reduced wastage and customer saftisfaction.<br>
					<br>
					What then will all these do?<br>
					<br>
					Increase your money.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style= "font-weight: bold;">20. Get Promoted</h3>
					Getting promoted at your workplace is a guarantee that your salary will be increased.<br>
					<br>
					Is that not the reason why it is termed 'promotion'?<br>
					<br>
					When you are promoted, you are moved to the next level that matches your competence and performance.<br>
					<br>
					Your responsiblities increase and as such your entitlement also increase.<br>
					<br>
					So improve yourself, work hard, get promoted and witness your money increase.<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					There you have it. These are some twenty (20) ways by which you can increase your money in Ghana.<br>
					<br>
					Of course, you cannot undertake all but make every effort to engage in some as you will never regret for 
					doing so.<br>
					<br>
					I conclude by sounding a note of caution.<br>
					<br>
					Investments carry risk of money loss. It beholds on you to carry out proper and diligent research before you 
					engage in any financial or investment activity.

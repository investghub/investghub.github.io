					I did not have the experience to know what it took to survive not to talk of succeeding. I learnt this the hard way. 
					I was trying so many things at once and got so frustrated that I quit for long periods of time. Then I began to painstakingly  
					research and got to the level where I am now and since then my desire is to make sure that fellow Ghanaians do not go through 
					same.<br>
					<br>
					Before we dive into the how! Let us take a look at Attitudes and Mindsets required to successfully earn money online. <br>

				investment: 
				<br>

				An exchange is a platform where you can buy, invest and sell cryptocurrencies. As it goes, there are so many exchanges and 
				you need to be careful when choosing one. I recommend the following two exchanges due to their reliability, trustworthiness 
				and ease at which you can invest in cryptocurrencies:<br>
				<br>
				Binance <small class="text-muted">(click logo to visit website)</small><br>

					<br>
					<br>
				<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">2. Buy Cryptocurrencies That are of Good Reputation</h4>
				Not all cryptocurrencies are worthy of your investment. So many are just quick-rich schemes that almost always end up in disappointment 
				and loss of funds. I bring to you cryptocurrencies that are of good repute, backed by strong community and strong management system. <br>

				With all said and done, I bring to your doorstep 3 proven and trusted ways to earn money online through cryptocurrency 
				investment: 
				<br>
				<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">1. Use a Trusted Crypto Exchange</h4>
				An exchange is a platform where you can buy, invest and sell cryptocurrencies. As it goes, there are so many exchanges and 
				you need to be careful when choosing one. I recommend the following two exchanges due to their reliability, trustworthiness 
				and ease at which you can invest in cryptocurrencies:<br>
				<br>
				Binance <small class="text-muted">(click logo to visit website)</small><br>

					<br>
				<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">2. Buy Cryptocurrencies That are of Good Reputation</h4>
				Not all cryptocurrencies are worthy of your investment. So many are just quick-rich schemes that almost always end up in disappointment 
				and loss of funds. I bring to you cryptocurrencies that are of good repute, backed by strong community and strong management system. <br>

					<br>
					<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">What is Eclipse Earn?</h4>
					According to their website, Eclipse Earn operates as a trading platform designed to bring Bitcoin to a market eager 
					for every opportunity to succeed. They further state that their platform enjoys better security and an offer any 
					potential crypto investor cannot ignore.<br>

					 Eclipse Earn, according to its website, can be assessed on various devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones 
					 provided the user has a stable connection and browser. The platform is accessible through web and mobile-oriented devices.<br>
					 <br>
					 <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Countries Eclipse Earn Operates</h4>
					Eclipse Earn states that its offers are available to most countries excluding the USA and may not also be available to 
					countries with specific financial regulations or restrictions.<br>
					<br>
					<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Is There A Deposit Limit on Eclipse Earn?</h4>
					Eclipse Earn requests a minimum deposit of $250 to start trading on its platform. There is no stated maximum deposit limit<br>
					<br>
					<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Does Eclipse Earn Have Customer Support?</h4>
					Eclipse Earn does have a customer support email address on their website. Users are provided a form-based system, where 
					users can submit their inquiries or issues. However, there are no specific information regarding support channels 
					or availability for registered users. There is no indication of additional support options like email or live chat. 
					The form-based support is intended to address user questions or problems, but the details on response times or the 
					extent of assistance offered are not clearly stated.<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Is Eclipse Earn A Scam?</h4>
					Eclipse Earn claims on its website to be a cryptocurrency trading platform operating within a legal framework and urges its   
					users in its <b>"Important Risk Note:"</b> as follows:<br>
					<br>
					<i>"It should be noted that cryptocurrency trading can be a highly risky investment and should be approached with caution, 
						especially during times of extreme volatility. Data suggests that roughly 70% of investors will lose money at some 
						point in time. However, the market can also be quite lucrative with the right trades. <br>

						Keep in mind that Eclipse Earn, in addition to any other commercial names used on this platform, are for commercial 
						purposes only. Make sure to read the Terms and Conditions thoroughly, as that will provide everything you need to know 
						about how we operate.<br>
						
						In addition to that, a policy has been issued by the FCA that prohibits the dissemination of marketing materials related 
						to the distribution of CFDs and other financial products on cryptocurrencies. However, this is only addressed to residents 
						in the UK.<br>
						
						Regarding your personal information, you consent to allow us to share your personal details with necessary third parties. 
						This is primarily related to entities that provide trading services in line with our Privacy Policy and Terms 
						and Conditions."</i><br>
						<br>
						<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Some Notable Concerns</h5>
						Despite Eclipse Earn's claims to be a trading platform that offers ways to maximize earns securely, the following are 
						some notable concerns:<br>
						<ul style="list-style-type: square;"></ul>
							<li>The minimum deposit of $250 (GHS3932.50) is so prohibitive to many Ghanaians. How many well meaning Ghanaians can 
								afford to raise suge an amount.</li>
							<li>There are no stated guaranteed profits aside just requesting a $250 minimum deposit. This maybe a cover up on any 
								unexpected losses an investor may incur.</li>
							<li>There are hardly any reviews on Eclipse Earn to find on the internet or anywhere else.</li>
							<li>A website promoting Eclipse Earn displayed some outrageous amounts in dollars that Ghanaians were purportedly 
								investing. If it is a legit ploy to attract investors, then why the deceitful portrayals. Na Ghana we dey o.</li>
							<li>Limited transparency about the team behind the platform and its operations. For prove, take a good look at their 
								"Terms and Conditions".
							</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						To determine if Eclipse Earn is a scam or a legitimate service requires users to verify the platform's claims through 
						independent reviews and seek feedback from other traders. Users can also check for regulatory compliance and ensuring 
						that the platform adheres to industry standards.<br>
						<br>
						<hr>
						<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">MY VERDICT ON ECLIPSE EARN</h4>
						Eclipse Earns's own statement <i>"Data suggests that roughly 70% of investors will lose money at some point in time"</i> and 
						their express indication of not being held liable or accountable to any user in its Terms and Conditions, should be a 
						strong signal for potential users to always exercise due diligence and consider the risks involved before investing on 
						the platform.<br>
						<br>
						The minimum deposit is so huge, even for me, to begin to try and see. <b>Ghanaians, the ball is in your court.</b>

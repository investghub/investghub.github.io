					<br>
					Have you ever had the thought of trading stocks in a way that maximizes profits, Eclipse Earn might have the 
					features you seek—but be warned, as with any trading platform, there are two sides to the coin.<br>
					<br>
					In this review, we’ll explore the key features, functionality, and potential advantages of Eclipse Earn, and assess 
					the legitimacy of the platform.<br>
					<br>
					<img height="250" src="./assets/img/demo/eclipse-earn.JPG" alt="Eclipse Earn pic" class="shadow">
					<br>
					<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">What is Eclipse Earn?</h3>
					According to their website, Eclipse Earn operates as a trading platform designed to bring Bitcoin to a market eager 
					for every opportunity to succeed.<br>
					<br>
					They further state that their platform enjoys better security and an offer any 
					potential crypto investor cannot ignore.<br>
					<br>
					Eclipse Earn claims their platform offers so much convenience to enable traders from all backgrounds and abilities to 
					connect.<br>
					<br>
					According to Eclipse Earn, this diverse number of backgrounds has become one of the greatest advantages at 
					Eclipse Earn since potential investors receive support from the best.<br>
					<br>
					It is extremely worthy to note that while the platform claims to offer massive returns for its users, it is important 
					to do your own reasearch and proceed with caution before engaging with any trading platform.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Who Are The Team/Creator(s) of Eclipse Earn?</h3>
					The Eclipse Earn website does not mention of any team/creator of the platform but only stresses how the platform can 
					streamline the process of trading and eliminate much of the hassle that investors might encounter with other platforms.<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">How Does Eclipse Earn Work?</h3>
					Eclipse Earn operates as a Bitcoin trading platform that uses quantum computing machine to assist users in navigating 
					the vast ocean of digital asset market.<br>
					<br>
					The foundational objective of the platform is to provide traders with tools 
					and insights to make informed investment decisions.<br>
					<br>
					Let us take a look at what Eclipse earn claims to perform:<br>
					<br>
					<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Secure Platform</h5>
					Eclipse Earn promises the safety of investor's money with security being one of the top priorities of the platform.<br>
					<br>
					According to them, they utilize the latest and best practices for security to ensure that monies invested stay safe. <br>
					<br>
					Users are also assured of the platform following set protocol and using encryption to protect their data from cybercriminals. <br>
					<br>
					In addition, the platform offers users the option to choose to use the two-factor authentication to guarantee that only 
					authorized users can access their accounts.<br>
					<br>
					<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Streamlining the Process</h5>
					Eclipse Earn encourages users to trade easily on their platform as it suits them. <br>
					<br>
					To facilitate that, the platform utilizes a sub-platform called Everix Edge which is designed for intuitive navigation of 
					Eclipse Earn. <br>
					<br>
					Users are given the opprtunity to analyze the combined trading data to see when to make the most profitable trades 
					with all of these comprehensive trading data found from several feeds put into a single and scalable interface.<br>
					<br>
					<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Improve Trading Experience Of Users</h5>
					Eclipse Earn asserts that users are connected with an experienced account manager once they sign up with the platform.<br>
					<br> 
					This manager can set a user up and help with trades as compared to other trading platforms where users are overwhelmed 
					 with data. <br>
					 <br>In as much as every user is presented with plentty data, Eclipse Earn claims but they make the display much simpler 
					 by taking the essential data and placing them upfront where users can use it to make informed and profitable trades.<br>
					 <br>

					Eclipse Earn requests a minimum deposit of $250 to start trading on its platform. <br>
					<br>
					There is no stated maximum deposit limit<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Does Eclipse Earn Have Customer Support?</h3>
					Eclipse Earn does have a customer support email address on their website. <br>
					<br>
					Users are provided a form-based system, where users can submit their inquiries or issues. <br>
					<br>

					<br>
					The form-based support is intended to address user questions or problems, but the details on response times or the 
					extent of assistance offered are not clearly stated.<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Is Eclipse Earn A Scam?</h3>
					Eclipse Earn claims on its website to be a cryptocurrency trading platform operating within a legal framework and urges its   
					users in its <b>"Important Risk Note:"</b> as follows:<br>
					<br>
					<i>"It should be noted that cryptocurrency trading can be a highly risky investment and should be approached with caution, 
						especially during times of extreme volatility. <br>
						<br>
						Data suggests that roughly 70% of investors will lose money at some 
						point in time. <br>
						<br>
						However, the market can also be quite lucrative with the right trades. <br>
						<br>
						Keep in mind that Eclipse Earn, in addition to any other commercial names used on this platform, are for commercial 
						purposes only. <br>
						<br>
						Make sure to read the Terms and Conditions thoroughly, as that will provide everything you need to know 
						about how we operate.<br>
						<br>
						In addition to that, a policy has been issued by the FCA that prohibits the dissemination of marketing materials related 
						to the distribution of CFDs and other financial products on cryptocurrencies. <br>
						<br>
						However, this is only addressed to residents in the UK.<br>
						<br>
						Regarding your personal information, you consent to allow us to share your personal details with necessary third parties. <br>
						<br>
						This is primarily related to entities that provide trading services in line with our Privacy Policy and Terms 
						and Conditions."</i><br>
						<br>
						<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Some Notable Concerns</h3>
						Despite Eclipse Earn's claims to be a trading platform that offers ways to maximize earns securely, the following are 
						some notable concerns:<br>
						<ul style="list-style-type: square;"></ul>
							<li>The minimum deposit of $250 (GHS3932.50) is so prohibitive to many Ghanaians. How many well meaning Ghanaians can 
								afford to raise suge an amount.</li>
							<li>There are no stated guaranteed profits aside just requesting a $250 minimum deposit. This maybe a cover up on any 
								unexpected losses an investor may incur.</li>
							<li>There are hardly any reviews on Eclipse Earn to find on the internet or anywhere else.</li>
							<li>A website promoting Eclipse Earn displayed some outrageous amounts in dollars that Ghanaians were purportedly 
								investing. If it is a legit ploy to attract investors, then why the deceitful portrayals. Na Ghana we dey o.</li>
							<li>Limited transparency about the team behind the platform and its operations. For prove, take a good look at their 
								"Terms and Conditions".
							</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						To determine if Eclipse Earn is a scam or a legitimate service requires users to verify the platform's claims through 
						independent reviews and seek feedback from other traders. <br>
						<br>
						Users can also check for regulatory compliance and ensuring 
						that the platform adheres to industry standards.<br>
						<br>
						<hr>
						<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">MY VERDICT ON ECLIPSE EARN</h3>
						Eclipse Earns's own statement <i>"Data suggests that roughly 70% of investors will lose money at some point in time"</i> and 
						their express indication of not being held liable or accountable to any user in its Terms and Conditions, should be a 
						strong signal for potential users to always exercise due diligence and consider the risks involved before investing on 
						the platform.<br>
						<br>
						The minimum deposit is so huge, even for me, to begin to try and see. <br>
						<br>
						<b>Ghanaians, the ball is in your court.</b>
